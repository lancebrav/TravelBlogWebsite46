                    <p>We stayed for three nights in a beachside shack, and it was almost perfect in every way. The value for money was exceptional.

                    <p>We went to the snake island, the water there was very fresh, the turtles and the fish could be seen below. The road were very difficult to traverse since the ravines were harsh, overall, 
                    Port Barton was the most difficult to explore but the hard work is very worth it! I'd recommend this place 10/10</p>
